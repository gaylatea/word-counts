# Coding Exercise 1

##Premise
Generate a list of a million words, then use a non-brute-force method to efficiently count them and return the top 5 words that appear in the entire corpus.

I do use a brute-force method for memory/time comparisons, though.

Two additional methods are tried - a single-threaded reducer, and a distributed reducer in the same vein as a larger Map/Reduce style system.
